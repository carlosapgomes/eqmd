# Video Compression System Investigation Plan

## Background

- Video compression system not functioning
- Files uploading as .mov instead of compressed .mp4
- Error message: "VideoClip module not loaded - falling back to basic functionality"
- Previous fix attempts by Gemini and Claude were unsuccessful

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Module Loading Verification

- [x] **1.1 Add Debug Logging to Entry Points** ✅

  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip module loading...')` at the top of `videoclip-upload.js`
  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip module fully loaded')` at the end of the file
  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip IIFE executing...')` inside the IIFE before any code
  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip IIFE completed, window.VideoClip =', window.VideoClip)` after the return statement

- [x] **1.2 Check Global Scope Assignment** ✅

  - ✅ Verify `window.VideoClip` is properly assigned in the browser console
  - ✅ Check if any other scripts are overriding the `VideoClip` global variable
  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip type before assignment:', typeof window.VideoClip)` before IIFE
  - ✅ Add `console.log('VideoClip type after assignment:', typeof window.VideoClip)` after IIFE

- [x] **1.3 Verify Module Structure** ✅
  - ✅ Confirm `VideoClip.init()` method exists and is callable
  - ✅ Check if `VideoClip.upload.initCompression()` is properly defined
  - ✅ Verify all required methods are exposed in the return statement
  
  **FINDINGS**: Debug logging successfully added to videoclip-upload.js and confirmed present in bundle. VideoCompressionPhase3 class properly defined in phase3-integration.js.

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Browser console shows `VideoClip availability: undefined` when DOMContentLoaded fires, but NONE of our debug logging from videoclip-upload.js appears in console.

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Bundle downloads successfully but webpack runtime fails to execute module 710 (VideoClip). Debug logs show:
- ✅ Bundle downloads with 200 status
- ✅ Script tag processed 
- ❌ Module 710 never executes (our VideoClip code)
- ❌ Webpack dependency chunks [717,28,934] may be missing

### 2. Webpack Configuration Analysis

- [x] **2.1 Examine Bundle Entry Points** ✅

  - Verify `videoclipUpload` entry in `webpack.config.js` includes all necessary files
  - Check if entry point order is correct (dependencies before main file)
  - Confirm CSS files are properly included

- [ ] **2.2 Analyze Generated Bundle**

  - Examine `videoclipUpload-bundle.js` for proper module initialization
  - Check for any module conflicts or overrides
  - Verify IIFE pattern is preserved in the bundled output
  - Look for any minification issues affecting global assignments

- [ ] **2.3 Check Dependency Inclusion**
  - Verify all 16 compression dependencies are included in the bundle
  - Check for any missing or incorrectly ordered dependencies
  - Confirm `phase3-integration.js` is properly included

### 3. DOM Ready Event Timing

- [ ] **3.1 Add Initialization Timing Logs**

  - Add `console.log('DOMContentLoaded fired at:', new Date().toISOString())` to the event listener
  - Add `console.log('VideoClip.init() called at:', new Date().toISOString())` before initialization
  - Add `console.log('Document readyState:', document.readyState)` to check DOM loading state

- [ ] **3.2 Implement Delayed Initialization**

  - Add a 500ms timeout before calling `VideoClip.init()` to ensure DOM is fully loaded
  - Compare behavior between immediate and delayed initialization
  - Test with different timeout values (100ms, 500ms, 1000ms)

- [ ] **3.3 Check for Race Conditions**
  - Verify the order of script loading in the browser network tab
  - Check if any dependencies are loaded after main module initialization
  - Test with `defer` attribute on script tags to control loading order

### 4. Compression System Availability Check

- [ ] **4.1 Verify VideoCompressionPhase3 Availability**

  - Add `console.log('VideoCompressionPhase3 availability:', typeof window.VideoCompressionPhase3)` before compression initialization
  - Check browser console for any errors during compression system loading
  - Verify `VideoCompressionPhase3` constructor is properly defined

- [ ] **4.2 Add Detailed Error Logging**

  - Enhance error handling in `initCompression()` method with more detailed logging
  - Add try-catch blocks around compression initialization code
  - Log specific error messages for each failure point

- [ ] **4.3 Check Feature Flag Dependencies**
  - Verify `CompressionFeatureFlags` is properly defined and accessible
  - Check for any missing utility classes referenced in error messages
  - Add conditional checks before accessing potentially undefined objects

### 5. Template Integration Verification

- [ ] **5.1 Examine Script Loading in Templates**

  - Verify `videoclip_form.html` is loading the correct bundle
  - Check for any duplicate or conflicting script loads
  - Confirm script loading order matches dependency requirements

- [ ] **5.2 Verify HTML Element IDs**

  - Check if all element IDs referenced in JavaScript exist in the HTML
  - Verify form element selectors match the actual DOM structure
  - Confirm upload form class names match between HTML and JS

- [ ] **5.3 Test with Minimal Template**
  - Create a simplified test template with only essential elements
  - Load only the video compression bundle without other scripts
  - Test initialization with minimal dependencies

### 6. Browser Cache and Static Files

- [ ] **6.1 Clear Browser Cache**

  - Test with completely cleared browser cache
  - Verify static files are being properly updated after builds
  - Check for any caching headers that might prevent updates

- [ ] **6.2 Verify Django Static File Serving**

  - Run `python manage.py collectstatic --clear` to ensure clean static files
  - Check static file paths in Django settings
  - Verify static files are being properly collected and served

- [ ] **6.3 Test in Different Browsers**
  - Test in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to rule out browser-specific issues
  - Check for any browser console errors that might differ between browsers
  - Verify module loading behavior is consistent across browsers

### 7. Minimal Working Example

- [ ] **7.1 Create Simplified Module**

  - Create a minimal `test-videoclip.js` with only essential functionality
  - Implement basic global object assignment without compression features
  - Test if simplified module loads correctly

- [ ] **7.2 Incremental Feature Addition**

  - Start with basic module and add features one by one
  - Add compression initialization as a separate step
  - Identify at which point the module fails to load

- [ ] **7.3 Test Direct Script Loading**
  - Test loading scripts directly (without webpack) to isolate bundling issues
  - Compare behavior between direct loading and webpack bundling
  - Check for any differences in global object assignment

## Documentation and Tracking

- [ ] **Record all findings in a structured log**
- [ ] **Document each test case and its outcome**
- [ ] **Track which approaches worked and which failed**
- [ ] **Note any unexpected behavior or error patterns**

## Success Criteria

- VideoClip module successfully loads and initializes
- Compression UI elements appear on the upload form
- Video files are properly compressed before upload
- No "VideoClip module not loaded" error message
- Files upload as compressed .mp4 instead of .mov

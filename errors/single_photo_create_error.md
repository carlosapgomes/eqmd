# Single Photo Create Error

## Error Message

Please, review @/home/carlos/projects/eqmd/apps/mediafiles/ and
@/home/carlos/projects/eqmd/docs/mediafiles/index.md

Right now, I am able to create a new image/photo event and upload a photo.
The system registers the event and show it in the patient's timeline with its
thumbnail
However, it seems that it can not retrieve the full image version when I click
the edit button.

Please, review how is the naming/referencing of the original image is been
implemented.

Is the same uuid been used as a primary key, and inserted in the full image
name and thumbnail name?

I tried already fix it, but it is still not working.

See an example of the error in the message bellow:

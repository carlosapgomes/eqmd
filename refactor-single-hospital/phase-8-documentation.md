# Phase 8: Documentation Update

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Complexity:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** Phase 7 completed

## Objectives

1. Update CLAUDE.md to reflect single-hospital architecture
2. Update project documentation and README
3. Remove hospital-related documentation
4. Update setup and deployment instructions
5. Update API documentation (if any)
6. Create migration guide from multi-hospital

## Tasks

### 1. Update CLAUDE.md - Major Rewrite

**Remove hospital-related sections:**
- [ ] Remove entire "Hospitals App" section
- [ ] Remove hospital context middleware documentation
- [ ] Remove hospital permission system details
- [ ] Remove hospital-related commands

**Update App Details sections:**

**Patients App** - Simplify hospital assignment logic:
```markdown
<!-- Before (complex hospital logic) -->
#### Hospital Assignment Logic

- **Admitted Patients** (inpatient, emergency, transferred): Require `current_hospital` assignment
- **Outpatients/Discharged**: No `current_hospital` assignment (hospital-independent)
- **Automatic Management**: Hospital assignments auto-cleared/set on status changes
- **Historical Tracking**: PatientHospitalRecord maintains treatment history across facilities
- **Form Validation**: Dynamic hospital field visibility based on patient status

<!-- After (simple status logic) -->
#### Patient Status Management

- **Patient Status**: Tracks patient care status (inpatient, outpatient, emergency, discharged, transferred)
- **Status-Based Access**: Different user roles have different access levels based on patient status
- **Form Validation**: Simple status validation without complex assignment logic
```

**Permission System** - Complete rewrite:
```markdown
<!-- Before (complex hospital + role permissions) -->
## Permission System

**Comprehensive role-based access control with hospital context**

### Core Framework
- **Hospital Context**: Status-dependent access control
- **Permission Rules**: Doctors: Full permissions, can discharge patients
- **Residents/Physiotherapists**: Full access to current hospital patients

<!-- After (simplified role-based) -->
## Permission System

**Simple role-based access control focused on medical professions**

### Core Framework
Located in `apps/core/permissions/`:
- **constants.py**: Profession types (Doctor, Resident, Nurse, Physiotherapist, Student)
- **utils.py**: Core permission functions (`can_access_patient`, `can_edit_event`, etc.)
- **decorators.py**: View decorators (`@patient_access_required`, `@doctor_required`)

### Permission Rules
- **Doctors**: Full access to all patients, can discharge patients
- **Residents/Physiotherapists**: Full access to all patients, cannot discharge
- **Nurses**: Access to all patients, limited status changes, cannot discharge
- **Students**: View-only access to outpatients and discharged patients only
- **Time limits**: 24-hour edit/delete window for events
```

**Update Essential Commands:**
```markdown
<!-- Remove hospital-related commands -->
# Development
uv run python manage.py runserver
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py makemigrations
uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

# Testing
uv run pytest                                      # All tests with coverage

- **dailynotes**: Daily evolution notes extending Event model
- **sample_content**: Template content management for various event types
- **mediafiles**: Secure media file management for medical images and videos
```

**Update Key Features:**
```markdown
### Key Features

```

### 3. Update Patient App Documentation

**Simplify patient documentation:**
```markdown
### Patients App

**Full CRUD patient management with tagging system and status tracking**

- Patient models: Patient, AllowedTag, Tag
- Search by name, ID, fiscal/health card numbers
- Status tracking: inpatient, outpatient, emergency, discharged, transferred
- Color-coded tagging system with web admin interface
- Dashboard widgets: patient stats, recent patients
- Template tags: `patient_status_badge`, `patient_tags`
- URL structure: `/patients/`, `/patients/<uuid>/`, `/patients/tags/`

#### Patient Status Management

- **Status Types**: inpatient, outpatient, emergency, discharged, transferred
- **Role-Based Access**: Different access levels based on user profession and patient status
- **Simple Validation**: Basic status validation without complex assignment logic
```

### 4. Remove Hospital-Related Documentation

- [ ] Remove hospital-related template tags documentation
- [ ] Remove hospital management commands

### 5. Update Permission System Documentation

**Rewrite permission documentation:**
```markdown
## Permission System

**Simple role-based access control for medical professionals**

### Permission Rules

**Doctors:**
- Full access to all patients regardless of status
- Can discharge patients
- Can edit patient personal data
- Can create and edit all types of events

**Residents/Physiotherapists:**
- Full access to all patients
- Cannot discharge patients
- Can edit patient data and create events

- Cannot edit patient personal data
- Can create daily notes and basic events

**Students:**
- Full access to all patients (same as other roles)
- Cannot edit patient personal data
- Cannot discharge patients
- Can create basic events and daily notes

### Key Functions

```python
can_access_patient(user, patient)           # Always True (all roles can access all patients)
can_edit_event(user, event)                 # Time-limited editing (24h)
can_change_patient_status(user, patient, status)  # Doctors/residents only for discharge
can_change_patient_personal_data(user, patient)   # Doctors/residents only
get_user_accessible_patients(user)          # Returns all patients for all roles
```

### Management Commands

```bash
uv run python manage.py setup_groups              # Create profession-based groups
uv run python manage.py permission_audit --action=report  # System audit
uv run python manage.py user_permissions --action=assign # Assign user to group
```
```

### 6. Update Setup and Installation Instructions

**Simplify setup instructions:**
```markdown
## Installation and Setup

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup:**

```

### 10. Create Migration Guide

**Create deployment guide for single-hospital:**
```markdown
# Single-Hospital Architecture Guide

This version uses a simplified single-hospital architecture without the complexity of multi-hospital management.

## Fresh Installation

1. **Clone the single-hospital branch:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   git checkout single-hospital-refactor
   ```

2. **Set up environment:**
   ```bash
   uv install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your hospital information:
   # HOSPITAL_NAME, HOSPITAL_ADDRESS, HOSPITAL_PHONE, etc.
   ```

3. **Create database:**
   ```bash
   uv run python manage.py migrate
   uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
   uv run python manage.py setup_groups
   ```

## For Existing Multi-Hospital Users

**Note:** This architecture is not compatible with existing multi-hospital data. For new installations only.

If you need multi-hospital functionality:
```bash
git checkout prescriptions  # Use original multi-hospital branch
```

## Benefits of Single-Hospital Architecture

- 60% simpler permission system
- 40% reduction in codebase complexity
- Faster development and testing
- Easier deployment and maintenance
- Better security through simplified permissions
```

### 11. Update Development Guidelines

**Simplify development guidelines:**
```markdown
## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features

1. **Follow role-based permissions** - Use existing permission functions
2. **Simple patient access** - Use `can_access_patient(user, patient)`
3. **Status-based logic** - Focus on patient status rather than location
4. **Template patterns** - Follow existing template inheritance

### Testing

- **Permission Tests**: Test role-based access patterns
- **Patient Tests**: Test status transitions and access
- **Event Tests**: Test time-based and role-based editing
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows

<!-- Remove hospital-related development guidelines -->
```

**Final Validation:** ✓ No hospital-related documentation remains, ✓ All commands use `uv run`, ✓ Documentation reflects simplified architecture, ✓ Obsolete files removed

## Critical Information for Next Phase

**Current Architecture State:** Single-hospital (configuration complete)  
**Database State:** Fresh migrations, hospital models removed  
**Permission Model:** Simple 2-tier role based (Doctors/Residents vs Others)  
**Key Models:** Hospital, PatientHospitalRecord removed  
**Hospital Configuration:** Environment-based (HOSPITAL_CONFIG settings implemented)  
**Analysis Results:** Complete inventory with 36 test files, 50+ Python files, and 34 templates requiring changes  

## Notes and Lessons Learned

### Phase 1 Insights

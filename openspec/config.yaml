  ## Purpose
  
  **EquipeMed** is a Django 5 medical team collaboration platform designed for single-hospital patient tracking and care management. It enables medical staff (doctors, residents, nurses, physiotherapists, students) to collaboratively manage patient care through:
  
  - Patient admission and status tracking
  - Daily evolution notes and medical events
  - Secure media file management (photos/videos)
  - Hospital-specific PDF form generation
  - Role-based access control for medical professionals
  - Comprehensive audit history and security monitoring
  - User lifecycle management with automated account expiration
  
  The platform emphasizes simplicity, security, and compliance with medical record-keeping requirements while providing a modern, responsive interface.

  ## Project Conventions
  
  ### Code Style
  
  #### Python (Django)
  
  - **PEP 8** compliant
  - **Django conventions** for app structure and naming
  - **Model naming**: Singular (e.g., `Patient`, `Event`, `DailyNote`)
  - **View naming**: Descriptive function/class names (e.g., `patient_detail`, `PatientCreateView`)
  - **URL patterns**: Lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `patient-create`, `event-edit`)
  - **Manager methods**: Use custom managers for complex queries (e.g., `Patient.objects.active()`)
  - **UUID primary keys**: All models use UUIDs instead of auto-increment IDs for security
  
  #### JavaScript
  
  - **ES6+ syntax** preferred
  - **Vanilla JavaScript** for admin interface (NO Bootstrap JS)
  - **Bootstrap JavaScript** allowed for user-facing templates only
  - **Module pattern** for organization
  - **Clear function naming**: Descriptive and action-oriented
  
  #### CSS/SCSS
  
  - **BEM methodology** where appropriate
  - **Bootstrap utilities** first, custom CSS second
  - **Separate files** per feature/component in `assets/scss/`
  - **Never edit** `static/` directly - always edit `assets/` and rebuild with Webpack
  
  ### Architecture Patterns
  
  #### App Structure
  
  - **Small, focused apps**: Each app handles a specific domain (patients, events, dailynotes)
  - **Base models with inheritance**: `Event` base model extended by `DailyNote`, `SimpleNote`, etc.
  - **Manager pattern**: Custom managers for complex queries and business logic
  - **Service layer**: Complex business logic in separate service modules (e.g., `services/` directories)
  - **Template inheritance**: Base templates with blocks for consistent UI
  
  #### Key Patterns
  
  - **Event-based timeline**: All medical records inherit from `Event` base model with:
    - UUID primary key
    - Audit trail (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
    - 24-hour edit window enforcement
    - Patient relationship
  - **Permission system**: Simple role-based with `core.permissions` module:
    - Universal patient access (all staff can view all patients)
    - Role-specific actions (discharge, edit personal data)
    - Time-window validation for event editing
  - **Hospital configuration**: Environment-based single hospital setup via template tags
  - **Audit history**: Comprehensive change tracking using django-simple-history
  - **User lifecycle**: Automated expiration and renewal workflows for temporary staff
  
  #### Database Design
  
  - **UUID primary keys** for security
  - **Audit fields** on all models (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
  - **Soft deletes** where appropriate
  - **History tables** for all critical models
  - **Indexed foreign keys** for performance
  
  ### Testing Strategy
  
  #### Test Organization
  
  - **Per-app test directories**: Each app has `tests/` directory with separate files
  - **Factory pattern**: factory-boy for test data generation
  - **pytest preferred**: Use pytest for most tests (faster, better features, coverage)
  - **Django test runner**: Use for apps with specific Django test requirements
  
  #### Test Types
  
  - **Unit tests**: Model methods, utility functions, business logic
  - **Integration tests**: View tests with database interactions
  - **Permission tests**: Role-based access control validation
  - **Form tests**: Form validation and data processing
  - **Template tests**: Template rendering and context
  
  #### Running Tests
  
  ```bash
  # Pytest (recommended)
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.test_settings uv run pytest
  
  # Django test runner (for specific apps)
  uv run python manage.py test apps.patients.tests
  
  # Coverage reports
  DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.test_settings uv run pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html
  ```
  
  #### Test Requirements
  
  - **All new features** must have tests
  - **Coverage goal**: 80%+ for new code
  - **Test both success and failure paths**
  - **Test permissions** for all protected views
  - **Test edge cases** (empty data, invalid input, boundary conditions)
  
  ### Git Workflow
  
  #### Branching Strategy
  
  - **master**: Production-ready code
  - **dev**: Development branch (primary working branch)
  - **feature/***: Feature branches from dev
  - **fix/***: Bug fix branches from dev
  - **hotfix/***: Emergency fixes from master
  
  #### Commit Conventions
  
  - **Descriptive messages**: Clear, concise, action-oriented
  - **Type prefixes**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
  - **Examples**:
    - `feat(patients): add bulk patient import functionality`
    - `fix(dailynotes): resolve duplicate note creation bug`
    - `docs: update deployment guide for registry setup`
    - `refactor(events): extract timeline logic to service layer`
    - `test(permissions): add admission edit permission tests`
  
  #### Workflow
  
  1. Create feature branch from `dev`
  2. Make changes with descriptive commits
  3. Run tests locally
  4. Push and create pull request to `dev`
  5. After review and merge to `dev`, periodically merge `dev` to `master`

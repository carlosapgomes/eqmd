# Task ID: 40
# Title: Final Integration Testing and Deployment Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 39
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform final testing and prepare for deployment
# Details:
Run complete integration test suite. Test cross-browser compatibility for print functionality. Verify all permission scenarios work correctly. Test data migration scripts. Create deployment checklist and rollback procedures. Prepare production configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Execute full test suite, perform user acceptance testing, verify deployment checklist completeness, test rollback procedures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Run Full Integration Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Execute comprehensive integration testing covering all critical integration points using a balanced approach such as incremental integration testing. Prioritize tests based on risk and functionality, use realistic test data, and automate tests where possible to ensure early detection of integration issues.
### Details:
Plan and prioritize integration tests focusing on high-risk areas. Use realistic data sets that mimic production environments. Employ automation tools and integrate tests into the CI pipeline for continuous testing. Isolate modules for targeted testing and refine test cases regularly to adapt to new features.

## 2. Conduct Cross-Browser Print Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Verify that printing functionality works correctly across all supported browsers and platforms, ensuring consistent output and formatting.
### Details:
Test print layouts and outputs on major browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) and different operating systems. Identify and fix any discrepancies in print rendering, styles, or permissions that could affect user experience.

## 3. Verify Permissions and Access Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Test and validate user permissions and access controls to ensure security policies are correctly enforced across the application.
### Details:
Perform role-based access testing to confirm that users can only access authorized features and data. Include negative testing to verify that unauthorized access is properly blocked. Automate permission tests where feasible to maintain coverage during ongoing development.

## 4. Test Data Migration Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1
### Description: Validate the accuracy and integrity of data migration scripts by running them in a controlled environment and verifying the results.
### Details:
Execute migration scripts on representative datasets and compare pre- and post-migration data for consistency. Check for data loss, corruption, or transformation errors. Include rollback testing to ensure migrations can be safely reversed if needed.

## 5. Prepare Deployment and Rollback Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 40.1, 40.4
### Description: Develop and document detailed deployment and rollback plans to minimize risks during production release.
### Details:
Create step-by-step deployment instructions including environment setup, configuration, and validation checks. Define rollback criteria and procedures to quickly restore previous stable states in case of failure. Test deployment and rollback processes in staging environments to ensure readiness.

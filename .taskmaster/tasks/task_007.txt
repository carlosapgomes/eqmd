# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement DrugTemplate Detail View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create detailed view for individual drug templates with usage statistics
# Details:
Create DrugTemplateDetailView using DetailView. Display all template fields, show usage count (number of prescriptions using this template), display creation/modification dates. Add edit/delete links for template creator. Apply permission checks for private template access.

# Test Strategy:
Test template detail display, verify permission checks for private templates, test usage statistics calculation, verify edit/delete links appear only for creators

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create DetailView for Object Display [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a Django DetailView class-based view to display detailed information of a single object, specifying the model, template, and context object name.
### Details:
Define a class inheriting from django.views.generic.detail.DetailView, set the model attribute to the relevant model, specify context_object_name for template clarity, and optionally set template_name if default naming is not used.

## 2. Display Usage Statistics in DetailView [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Enhance the DetailView to include usage statistics related to the object, adding necessary data to the context for template rendering.
### Details:
Override the get_context_data method in the DetailView subclass to add usage statistics data to the context dictionary, enabling display in the detail template.

## 3. Add Permission Checks to DetailView [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement permission logic to restrict access to the DetailView based on user roles or other criteria.
### Details:
Incorporate permission checks by overriding the dispatch or get method in the DetailView to verify user permissions before rendering the view, redirecting or raising errors if unauthorized.

## 4. Implement Edit/Delete Link Visibility Based on Permissions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Control the visibility of edit and delete links in the detail template depending on the user's permissions.
### Details:
Pass permission flags or user role information to the template context and use conditional template logic to show or hide edit/delete links accordingly.

# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create DrugTemplate URL Patterns
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure URL routing for all drug template views
# Details:
Create urls.py in drugtemplates app. Define URL patterns: '' (list), 'create/' (create), '<int:pk>/' (detail), '<int:pk>/edit/' (update), '<int:pk>/delete/' (delete). Use name parameter for reverse lookups. Set app_name='drugtemplates' for namespacing. Include in main urls.py with 'drugtemplates/' prefix.

# Test Strategy:
Test all URL patterns resolve correctly, verify reverse URL lookups work, test namespacing functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define URL Patterns in App's urls.py [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and organize URL patterns specific to each Django app in its own urls.py file, using path converters for dynamic routing.
### Details:
Use Django's path() function to define URL patterns that map URLs to views within the app. Include dynamic segments with converters like <int:id> or <slug:slug> for flexible routing. Keep patterns simple and readable to enhance maintainability.

## 2. Set app_name for URL Namespacing [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Assign an app_name variable in the app's urls.py to enable URL namespacing for reverse lookups and avoid naming conflicts.
### Details:
Add the app_name string at the top of the app's urls.py file to define a namespace. This allows referencing URLs with the namespace prefix in templates and views, improving clarity and preventing clashes between apps with similar URL names.

## 3. Include App URLs in Main Project Routing [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Integrate each app's URL patterns into the main project's urls.py using the include() function and the app's namespace.
### Details:
In the project's main urls.py, use path() with include() to incorporate the app's urls.py patterns under a specific URL prefix. This modular approach keeps the project routing organized and leverages the app_name for namespaced URL reversing.

# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 36
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complete test coverage for both apps
# Details:
Create unit tests for all models, forms, and views. Add integration tests for complete workflows. Test permission scenarios and edge cases. Create test data factories. Add test cases for data independence. Achieve >90% test coverage.

# Test Strategy:
Run test suite with coverage reporting, verify all critical paths tested, test edge cases and error conditions

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Unit Tests for Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop unit tests to verify the correctness of model methods, field validations, and database interactions.
### Details:
Write tests for model field constraints, custom methods, and string representations to ensure data integrity and expected behavior.

## 2. Develop Unit Tests for Forms [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1
### Description: Implement unit tests to validate form input handling, field validations, and error messages.
### Details:
Test form validation logic including required fields, custom validators, and form submission scenarios.

## 3. Write Unit Tests for Views [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2
### Description: Create unit tests for view functions and class-based views to check response status, context data, and template rendering.
### Details:
Use Django's RequestFactory or test client to simulate requests and verify view outputs and side effects.

## 4. Implement Integration Tests for Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Design integration tests that cover end-to-end workflows involving multiple components like models, views, and templates.
### Details:
Test interactions between components to ensure they work together correctly, including database state changes and API responses.

## 5. Create Permission Scenario Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.3
### Description: Develop tests to verify access control and permission enforcement across different user roles and scenarios.
### Details:
Simulate requests from users with varying permissions to ensure unauthorized access is properly restricted and authorized access is granted.

## 6. Set Up Test Data Factories and Coverage Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 37.1, 37.2, 37.3, 37.4, 37.5
### Description: Establish test data factories for reusable test data creation and configure coverage tools to measure test coverage.
### Details:
Use libraries like factory_boy to create test data efficiently and integrate coverage.py or similar tools to generate coverage reports.

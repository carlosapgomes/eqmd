# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Prescription Create View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Create complex view for prescription creation with drug template integration
# Details:
Create OutpatientPrescriptionCreateView using CreateView. Handle both prescription form and item formset. Add drug template selection interface with AJAX for auto-population. Add prescription template selection. Implement data copying from templates to ensure independence. Apply @patient_access_required decorator.

# Test Strategy:
Test prescription creation workflow, verify drug template integration, test data copying independence, test form validation and submission

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Prescription Form and Item Formset [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure the main prescription form and an associated item formset to handle multiple prescription items within a single view.
### Details:
Use Django's forms and formsets (or modelformsets if tied to models) to build the prescription form and item formset. Ensure the formset can handle multiple items dynamically and supports validation and data binding on POST requests.

## 2. Implement AJAX Drug Template Selection [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Add AJAX functionality to allow dynamic selection and loading of drug templates without full page reloads.
### Details:
Create AJAX endpoints and JavaScript handlers to fetch drug template data asynchronously when a user selects a drug template. Update the item formset fields accordingly based on the selected template.

## 3. Implement Prescription Template Selection with Data Copying Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Enable selection of prescription templates that pre-fill the prescription form and item formset with predefined data.
### Details:
Develop logic to copy data from selected prescription templates into the main prescription form and item formset. This includes handling nested data and ensuring the formset updates correctly with the copied data.

## 4. Apply Decorators for Permissions and Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Secure the view by applying appropriate decorators to enforce user permissions and access control.
### Details:
Use Django decorators such as @login_required and custom permission decorators to restrict access to the prescription handling view, ensuring only authorized users can create or edit prescriptions.

## 5. Manage Validation and Submission Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation for both the prescription form and item formset, and handle form submission with proper error handling and success redirects.
### Details:
On POST requests, bind submitted data to forms and formsets, validate all inputs, handle errors by redisplaying forms with messages, and save valid data to the database. Ensure atomicity if needed.

## 6. Integrate All Components into a Complex View [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5
### Description: Combine the prescription form, item formset, AJAX drug and prescription template selection, decorators, and validation into a single cohesive Django view.
### Details:
Create a class-based or function-based view that orchestrates rendering the forms, handling AJAX requests, applying decorators, processing submissions, and managing validation and data copying logic seamlessly.

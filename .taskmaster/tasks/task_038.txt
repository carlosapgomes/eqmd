# Task ID: 38
# Title: Optimize Performance and Add Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 37
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and caching strategies
# Details:
Add database indexes for common query patterns. Implement select_related and prefetch_related optimizations. Add caching for template lists and frequently accessed data. Optimize formset rendering. Add pagination optimizations.

# Test Strategy:
Run performance tests, verify query optimization with Django Debug Toolbar, test caching functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze and Add Database Indexes [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile the database queries to identify slow queries and determine which fields would benefit from indexing. Add appropriate indexes to frequently queried fields using Django's db_index attribute or Meta.indexes option.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to find bottlenecks in database queries. Add single-column or composite indexes as needed, considering the trade-offs of index maintenance overhead. Implement indexes in Django models and migrate the database accordingly.

## 2. Implement select_related and prefetch_related Optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.1
### Description: Optimize ORM queries by using select_related for single-valued relationships and prefetch_related for many-valued relationships to reduce the number of database queries.
### Details:
Review query patterns to identify where related objects are accessed. Replace multiple queries with select_related or prefetch_related to fetch related data in fewer queries, improving performance.

## 3. Add Caching for Frequent Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.2
### Description: Implement caching mechanisms to store results of frequent and expensive queries to reduce database load and improve response times.
### Details:
Identify queries that are executed frequently and have relatively static results. Use Django's caching framework or external caches like Redis or Memcached to cache querysets or serialized data.

## 4. Optimize Formset Rendering and Pagination [pending]
### Dependencies: 38.3
### Description: Improve the performance of formset rendering and pagination by minimizing database hits and optimizing template rendering.
### Details:
Use pagination to limit the number of objects rendered at once. Optimize formset queries by using select_related/prefetch_related where applicable. Cache rendered pages or partials if possible to reduce repeated processing.

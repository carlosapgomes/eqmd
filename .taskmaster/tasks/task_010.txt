# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement DrugTemplate Delete View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create view for deleting drug templates with confirmation and dependency checks
# Details:
Create DrugTemplateDeleteView using DeleteView. Add permission check for creator only. Check if template is used in existing prescriptions before deletion. Show confirmation page with usage warning. Add success message and redirect to list view. Apply @login_required decorator.

# Test Strategy:
Test deletion permissions, verify confirmation page, test prevention of deletion when template is in use, verify success redirect

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create DeleteView for the model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a Django class-based DeleteView to handle the deletion of a specific model instance, including URL routing and template setup for the confirmation page.
### Details:
Define a DeleteView subclass for the target model, configure the URL pattern to point to this view, and create a basic confirmation template that asks the user to confirm deletion.

## 2. Add permission checks to DeleteView [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Integrate permission checks into the DeleteView to ensure only authorized users can perform deletions.
### Details:
Override the DeleteView methods to check user permissions before allowing deletion, such as using Django's built-in permission system or custom logic to restrict access.

## 3. Implement dependency checks before deletion [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add logic to verify if the object to be deleted has dependencies or related objects that prevent safe deletion.
### Details:
Before deleting, check for related objects or constraints that would cause data integrity issues if deleted. If dependencies exist, prevent deletion and provide appropriate feedback.

## 4. Create confirmation page with warnings [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Design and implement a confirmation page that warns users about the consequences of deletion, including any dependency-related warnings.
### Details:
Enhance the DeleteView confirmation template to display warnings about dependencies or other important information, ensuring users are fully informed before confirming deletion.

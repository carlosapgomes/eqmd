# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement PrescriptionTemplate Models
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create models for reusable prescription templates
# Details:
Create PrescriptionTemplate model with fields: name (CharField), creator (ForeignKey to User), is_public (BooleanField), created_at/updated_at (DateTimeFields). Create PrescriptionTemplateItem model with fields: template (ForeignKey), drug_name, presentation, usage_instructions, quantity, order. Add __str__ methods and Meta ordering.

# Test Strategy:
Test template model creation, verify relationships between template and items, test ordering and validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design PrescriptionTemplate and PrescriptionTemplateItem Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data models for PrescriptionTemplate and PrescriptionTemplateItem including fields, data types, and constraints based on pharmacy database design principles.
### Details:
Create PrescriptionTemplate model to represent a reusable prescription format. Create PrescriptionTemplateItem model to represent individual items (medicines or instructions) within a template. Include fields such as template name, description, item name, dosage, frequency, and any other relevant attributes.

## 2. Define Relationships and Ordering Between Models [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Establish the relationships between PrescriptionTemplate and PrescriptionTemplateItem models, including one-to-many association and ordering of items.
### Details:
Implement a one-to-many relationship where a PrescriptionTemplate has many PrescriptionTemplateItems. Add ordering functionality to PrescriptionTemplateItems to maintain a specific sequence within each template, ensuring correct prescription item order.

## 3. Implement Validation and Business Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Add validation rules and business logic to ensure data integrity and correct behavior of the PrescriptionTemplate and PrescriptionTemplateItem models.
### Details:
Validate required fields, enforce unique constraints where necessary, and ensure that ordering indices are consistent and non-conflicting. Include logic to handle updates and deletions that maintain relational integrity.

## 4. Write Unit and Integration Tests for Models and Relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests to verify the correctness of the PrescriptionTemplate and PrescriptionTemplateItem models, their relationships, ordering, and validations.
### Details:
Create tests to check model creation, relationship integrity, ordering correctness, and validation enforcement. Include edge cases such as empty templates, duplicate items, and invalid ordering values.

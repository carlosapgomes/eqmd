### Description: Organize and verify the directory structure of the new app and create any additional files needed for integration.
### Details:
Confirm the presence of the app folder with its default files (views.py, models.py, urls.py if needed, migrations folder, etc.). Create or modify files such as urls.py for routing and templates or static folders if required for the app's functionality.

# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Data Independence System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 31
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure prescription data independence from templates
# Details:
Implement copy_from_drug_template method in PrescriptionItem model. Create copy_from_prescription_template method in OutpatientPrescription model. Ensure all template data is copied rather than referenced. Add tests to verify template modifications don't affect existing prescriptions.

# Test Strategy:
Test data copying functionality, verify independence by modifying templates after prescription creation, confirm existing prescriptions remain unchanged

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement copy_from_drug_template method [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the copy_from_drug_template method to create a deep copy of the drug template data into the target object, ensuring no shared references remain.
### Details:
Use Python's copy.deepcopy() to recursively copy all attributes and nested objects from the drug template to the current instance. This prevents side effects from shared mutable objects.

## 2. Implement copy_from_prescription_template method [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1
### Description: Develop the copy_from_prescription_template method to create a deep copy of the prescription template data into the target object, ensuring complete data independence.
### Details:
Similarly to the drug template copy, use copy.deepcopy() to recursively copy all relevant data from the prescription template to the current instance, avoiding shared references.

## 3. Ensure deep copy of data in both methods [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.1, 33.2
### Description: Verify and enforce that both copy_from_drug_template and copy_from_prescription_template methods perform deep copies of all nested and mutable data structures.
### Details:
Review the implementation to confirm that copy.deepcopy() is used appropriately on all nested objects and attributes, preventing any shallow copy or reference sharing issues.

## 4. Write tests for data independence [pending]
### Dependencies: 33.3
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests to validate that the copied objects from both methods are fully independent and modifications to copies do not affect the originals.
### Details:
Design tests that modify nested data in the copied objects and assert that the original templates remain unchanged, confirming deep copy behavior and data independence.

# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement AJAX Drug Template Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create AJAX endpoints for drug template selection and auto-population
# Details:
Create AJAX view for drug template search and selection. Implement auto-population of prescription item fields when template is selected. Add JavaScript for seamless user experience. Create JSON endpoints for template data retrieval.

# Test Strategy:
Test AJAX endpoints return correct data, verify auto-population functionality, test JavaScript integration and error handling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create AJAX Search Endpoint [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a backend REST API endpoint to handle AJAX search requests, process search terms, query the database, and return search results in JSON format.
### Details:
Implement a REST API route (e.g., /search) that accepts GET or POST requests with a search parameter. Use backend logic to query relevant data (posts, pages, or custom post types) based on the search term and format the results for frontend consumption. Include error handling for no results found.

## 2. Implement Auto-Population Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1
### Description: Develop the logic to dynamically generate search suggestions or results as the user types in the search input field.
### Details:
Use the AJAX search endpoint to fetch matching results in real-time. Implement throttling or debouncing to optimize requests. Format and prepare the data to be displayed as suggestions or auto-complete options in the UI.

## 3. Add JavaScript Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.2
### Description: Integrate frontend JavaScript to connect the search input field with the AJAX endpoint and display auto-populated search results.
### Details:
Write JavaScript code to listen for input events on the search box, send AJAX requests to the backend endpoint, receive JSON responses, and update the UI with search suggestions. Ensure smooth user experience and accessibility.

## 4. Handle Error Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 35.1, 35.3
### Description: Implement error handling for both backend and frontend to manage cases such as no search results, network errors, or invalid input.
### Details:
On the backend, return appropriate error responses (e.g., WP_Error or HTTP error codes) when no results are found or input is invalid. On the frontend, detect these errors and display user-friendly messages or fallback UI states. Also handle network failures gracefully.

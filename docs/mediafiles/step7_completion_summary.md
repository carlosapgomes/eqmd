- Included comprehensive metadata storage strategy

**Tables Planned**:
1. `mediafiles_mediafile` - Core file storage and metadata
2. `mediafiles_photo` - Single photo events (inherits from Event)
3. `mediafiles_photoseries` - Photo series events (inherits from Event)
4. `mediafiles_videoclip` - Video clip events (inherits from Event)
5. `mediafiles_photoseriesfile` - Through table for photo series ordering

- Designed video thumbnail extraction strategy
- Implemented deduplication strategy using SHA-256 hashes
- Created backup and maintenance procedures

**Storage Structure**:
```
media/
├── photos/
│   ├── 2024/01/
│   │   ├── originals/
│   │   ├── large/
│   │   ├── medium/
│   │   └── thumbnails/
├── photo_series/
│   └── 2024/01/
│       ├── originals/
│       └── thumbnails/
└── videos/
    ├── 2024/01/
    │   ├── originals/
    │   └── thumbnails/
```

- Specified permission-based access control with audit logging
- Designed rate limiting and monitoring systems
- Planned secure file serving with proper headers
- Included HIPAA and GDPR compliance considerations

**Security Features**:
- UUID-based filenames prevent enumeration attacks
- Original filenames stored in database only
- No patient information in file paths
- File extension and MIME type validation
- SHA-256 hash calculation for deduplication
- Permission-based file access through Django views
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Rate limiting for uploads and downloads

### 7.4 Migration Strategy Planning ✅

**Deliverable**: Detailed database migration plan
**Location**: `docs/mediafiles/migration_plan.md`

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Designed phase-based migration approach for minimal risk
- Created complete migration scripts for all models
- Planned data migration for existing photo events
- Specified rollback procedures for each phase
- Included performance monitoring and validation scripts
- Designed comprehensive testing strategy

**Migration Phases**:
1. Phase 1: Core MediaFile model
2. Phase 2: Photo model (single images)
3. Phase 3: PhotoSeries and PhotoSeriesFile models
4. Phase 4: VideoClip model
5. Phase 5: Indexes and optimization

### 7.5 Model Documentation Update ✅

**Deliverable**: Updated models.py with comprehensive documentation
**Location**: `apps/mediafiles/models.py`

**Key Accomplishments**:
- Added detailed database schema documentation as comments
- Documented all planned model relationships
- Specified security features and file storage structure
- Included implementation roadmap for Phase 2 vertical slices
- Maintained clean separation between planning and implementation

## Architecture Decisions Documented

### Model Inheritance Strategy
- **Photo**: Inherits from Event, 1:1 relationship with MediaFile
- **PhotoSeries**: Inherits from Event, 1:M relationship with MediaFile through PhotoSeriesFile
- **VideoClip**: Inherits from Event, 1:1 relationship with MediaFile
- **MediaFile**: Core model for file storage and metadata

### Security Architecture
- **UUID-based naming**: Prevents file enumeration attacks
- **Path separation**: No patient data in file paths
- **Permission-based access**: All file serving through Django views
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive tracking of all file operations
- **Deduplication**: SHA-256 hash-based to prevent storage waste

### Performance Architecture
- **Year/month organization**: Keeps directories manageable
- **Multiple image sizes**: Optimized serving for different use cases
- **Strategic indexing**: Optimized database queries
- **CDN-ready structure**: Prepared for future scaling

## Integration with Existing System

### Event Model Integration ✅
- Leverages existing Event model inheritance pattern
- Uses existing event types (PHOTO_EVENT=3, PHOTO_SERIES_EVENT=9, VIDEO_CLIP_EVENT=10)
- Maintains consistency with existing apps (dailynotes, simplenotes, historyandphysicals)
- Preserves existing permission and audit systems

### Settings Integration ✅
- All required media settings already configured in `config/settings.py`
- Security settings properly defined
- File size limits and allowed types specified
- UUID-based naming and deduplication enabled

### URL Integration ✅
- MediaFiles app URLs already included in main `config/urls.py`
- Namespace properly configured
- Media file serving configured for development

## Validation and Verification

### Documentation Quality ✅
- **Comprehensive**: All aspects of database design covered
- **Detailed**: SQL schemas, Python code examples, security considerations
- **Actionable**: Clear implementation guidance for Phase 2
- **Maintainable**: Well-organized documentation structure

### Security Review ✅

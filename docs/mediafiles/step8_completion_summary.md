## Security Features Implemented

### File Naming Security
```python
# UUID-based secure naming with validation
def get_secure_upload_path(instance, filename: str) -> str:
    # 122 bits of entropy from UUID4
    # Extension validation
    # Path traversal protection
    # No patient information in paths
```

### File Validation Security
```python
# Comprehensive validation pipeline
def validate_media_file(file_obj, file_type):
    # Filename security validation
    # File size limits
    # Extension validation
    # MIME type validation with magic numbers
    # Malicious content detection
    # Format-specific validation
```

### Access Control Security
```python
# Permission-based file access
@login_required
def serve_media_file(request, file_id):
    # Authentication required
    # Permission checking
    # Hospital context validation
    # Audit logging
    # Rate limiting
```

### Response Security Headers
```python
# Comprehensive security headers
response['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
response['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
response['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
response['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'none';"
response['Cache-Control'] = 'private, max-age=3600'
```

## Security Measures Summary

### 1. File Upload Security

## Next Steps

### Ready for Step 9: Testing Infrastructure ✅
The security implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Security-focused unit tests
- Integration tests for access control
- Performance tests for rate limiting
- Penetration testing scenarios

# DailyNote Details Layout Optimization

## Problem

The current layout of the DailyNote details page is not optimized for mobile devices. The buttons at the top of the page are too big, and the content hierarchy is not clear.

Another problem that affects both mobile and desktop is that it seems that we have too much space occupied by the patient and dailynote information, when compared to the content itself.

Make a detailed step-by-step plan to optimize its layout both for mobile and desktop devices, considering the problems mentioned above. Think hard to be as detailed as possible and follow the testing, styling, and all the additional project's recommendations.

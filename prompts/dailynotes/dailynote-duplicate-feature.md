# DailyNote Duplicate Feature Implementation

## Your Mission

Create a detailed step-by-step plan to implement a duplicate feature for a dailynote. This feature should allow users to create a new dailynote for the current patient based on one of the existing dailynotes for the same patient. The new dailynote should have the same content as the original but a different event_datetime.

From a UI/UX perspective, the user should be able to duplicate a dailynote from two different places:

1. From the dailynote detail page, there should be a "Duplicar" or related icon button. When clicked, it should open a new page with a form to create a new dailynote. The form should be pre-filled with the content of the original dailynote, but the event_datetime field should be set to the current date and time.

2. From the timeline list page, there should be a "Duplicar" or related icon button next or in each dailynote card. When clicked, it should open a new page with a form to create a new dailynote. The form should be pre-filled with the content of the original dailynote, but the event_datetime field should be set to the current date and time.

Please pay attention to keep the existing design and functionalities.

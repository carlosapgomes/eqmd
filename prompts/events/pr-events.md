# Event Model Implementation

## Your Mission

Read the file @prompts/events/eventsapp.md and make a detailed step-by-step plan to implement its features using a vertical slicing approach. Think hard to be as detailed as possible and follow the testing, styling, and all the additional recommendations bellow.

## Important additional CONTEXT

### Styling

Read the file @docs/styling.md and follow its recommendations for any UI or templating related task. Remember to use django crispy forms and crispy bootstrap 5 whenever possible.

### Enhanced Test Configuration and Verification

1. **Verify Test Settings Include New App**

   - Ensure the new app is properly included in test settings
   - Test that the app can be imported in Django shell: `python manage.py shell -c "from apps.events.models import Event"`

2. **Test Runner Verification**

   - Document which test runner to use (pytest vs Django's test runner)
   - Provide specific commands for running tests:

     ```bash
     # Using pytest (recommended)
     pytest apps/events/tests.py -v --no-cov

     # Using Django test runner (if pytest fails)
     python manage.py test apps.events.tests
     ```

3. **Basic Functionality Verification**
   - Test model creation through Django shell
   - Verify admin interface accessibility
   - Run a simple smoke test to ensure no import errors

### Additional Testing Recommendations

1. **Add Test Configuration Section**

   - Include specific instructions for configuring pytest with Django
   - Document the relationship between `config.settings` and `config.test_settings`

2. **Error Troubleshooting Guide**

   - Common app configuration errors and solutions
   - How to verify app is properly registered in INSTALLED_APPS

3. **Testing Best Practices**
   - When to use Django shell for quick verification
   - How to structure tests in the apps/ directory structure

## Additional Recommendations

1. **For All Slices**:

   - Always verify app configuration before running complex tests
   - Use Django shell for quick verification of model changes
   - Test both positive and negative cases (e.g., permissions denied)

2. **For Views**:

   - Test with authenticated and unauthenticated users
   - Verify proper redirect behavior for unauthorized access
   - Test with various user roles/permissions

3. **For Forms**:

   - Test validation with both valid and invalid data
   - Verify error messages are displayed correctly
   - Test form submission with missing required fields

4. **For Templates**:

   - Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Test accessibility features
   - Ensure consistent styling with the rest of the application

5. **For Related Data**:
   - Test performance with large datasets
   - Implement pagination for related data lists
   - Consider using select_related/prefetch_related for optimization

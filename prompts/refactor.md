REFACTOR CONTEXT: I'm starting a single-hospital refactor for EquipeMed Django project. Please read @refactor-single-hospital/README.md for overview, then read
@refactor-single-hospital/refactor-progress.md for current status, then execute Phase 1 according to @refactor-single-hospital/phase-1-analysis.md.

OBJECTIVE: Complete Phase 1 analysis, update progress file with findings, create hospital-inventory.md as specified.

CRITICAL: Use search tools extensively to find all hospital references. This sets the foundation for all subsequent phases.

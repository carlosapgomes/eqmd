# Investigate Static Files in Apps Folders

## Overview

It seems that some static files were put inside the @apps/ folders, instead of the global static or assets folder.

## Your Mission

1. investigate which app is doing this and if those files are been added to the project css or js bundle files by webpack.
2. check if there is any duplication of the css classes or javascript code inside the templates of the same app.

Create a report analysing each app that has static files inside its folder.

Show me the report.

Please create a comprehensive implementation plan by merging the information from two files:
1. The PRD in `/prompts/outprescriptons/requirements.md` which contains the detailed requirements
2. The implementation instructions in `/prompts/outprescriptons/pr.md` which outlines the app structure and implementation approach

Create a new file named `implementation_plan.md` in the `/prompts/outprescriptons/` directory that:
- Maintains all the detailed requirements from the original PRD
- Incorporates the implementation details, task breakdown approach, UI/UX requirements, and integration requirements from the pr.md file
- Organizes the content in a logical structure with clear headings
- Ensures all information is preserved while eliminating any redundancy
- Follows the vertical slicing approach mentioned in pr.md
- Includes a detailed task breakdown with 20-30 distinct tasks, each having 3-5 subtasks

The final document should serve as a complete guide for implementing the Outpatient Prescription System according to the project's standards and patterns.

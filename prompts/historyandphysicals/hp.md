I need to create a new app in the @apps/ folder that has exactly the same structure and features of the @apps/dailynotes/ app, however it should have another name
(historyandphysicals), because it will have a different sematic in the patient record. "History and Physicals" exist to keep track of more broad information
about a patient's health history, but the event features are all the same of dailynotes'. Correct me if I am wrong, but if you agree with this approach, make a
detailed step-by-step plan to duplicate all the structure and features of @apps/dailynotes into a new app called "historyandphysicals" to be created in a folder
with the same name

# LGPD Compliance Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements minimum LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados) compliance for the EquipeMed medical platform. The implementation is divided into sequential phases that build upon each other to achieve legal compliance while minimizing disruption to medical operations.

## Project Context

**System**: EquipeMed - Django-based medical collaboration platform  
**Scope**: Single hospital, small medical team (doctors, nurses, residents)  
**Data Types**: Patient medical records, staff professional data  
**Compliance Target**: LGPD minimum requirements (Articles 7, 9, 11, 18, 37, 48, 52)

**Key Articles for Medical Data:**
- **Article 7**: Legal basis for personal data processing
- **Article 9**: Information to be provided to data subjects  
- **Article 11**: Legal basis for sensitive data (health records)
- **Article 18**: Data subject rights (access, correction, deletion, portability)
- **Article 37**: Record of processing activities
- **Article 48**: Security incident communication
- **Article 52**: Administrative sanctions (fines up to 50 million reais)

## Implementation Status

**Current State**: NON-COMPLIANT  
**Risk Level**: HIGH (processing sensitive health data without LGPD protections)  
**Target**: Minimum legal compliance within 8 weeks

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Legal Foundation (Week 1-2)

- **File**: `phase_1_legal_foundation.md`
- **Focus**: Document legal basis, create basic compliance infrastructure
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Establishes legal framework
- **Dependencies**: None

### Phase 2: Patient Rights System (Week 3-4)

- **File**: `phase_2_patient_rights.md`
- **Focus**: Implement data access/correction request system
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core LGPD Article 18 requirements
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completed

### Phase 3: Privacy Transparency (Week 5-6)

- **File**: `phase_3_privacy_transparency.md`
- **Focus**: Privacy policies, data processing notices, consent management
- **Priority**: HIGH - Article 9 transparency requirements
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 completed

### Phase 4: Data Lifecycle Management (Week 7-8)

- **File**: `phase_4_data_lifecycle.md`
- **Focus**: Retention policies, deletion procedures, automated cleanup
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Article 15-16 data minimization
- **Dependencies**: Phases 1-2 completed

### Phase 5: Breach Response System (Week 9-10)

- **File**: `phase_5_breach_response.md`
- **Focus**: Incident detection, notification procedures, ANPD reporting
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Article 48 breach notification
- **Dependencies**: Phases 1-4 completed

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Maintenance (Week 11-12)

- **File**: `phase_6_monitoring_maintenance.md`
- **Focus**: Ongoing compliance monitoring, audit procedures, staff training
- **Priority**: LOW - Operational sustainability
- **Dependencies**: All previous phases

## Quick Reference

### Critical Implementation Order

1. **Legal Basis Documentation** (Phase 1) - Required for all processing
2. **Patient Data Request System** (Phase 2) - Core LGPD rights
3. **Privacy Policy** (Phase 3) - Transparency requirement
4. **Retention Management** (Phase 4) - Data minimization
5. **Breach Procedures** (Phase 5) - Risk management
6. **Ongoing Monitoring** (Phase 6) - Compliance maintenance

## Risk Mitigation

### Immediate Actions (Pre-Implementation)

- [x] Remove false LGPD compliance claims from landing page
- [ ] Designate Data Protection Officer (DPO) responsible person
- [ ] Create basic incident response contact procedures
- [ ] Document current data processing activities

### Legal Protection Strategy

- Implement **minimum viable compliance** first (Phases 1-3)
- Build **incrementally** to avoid system disruption
- Focus on **highest-risk areas** (patient data, breach response)
- Maintain **audit trails** throughout implementation

### Medical Operations Continuity

- No interruption to patient care during implementation
- Gradual introduction of new procedures
- Staff training integrated with rollout
- Fallback procedures for system issues

## Success Metrics

### Legal Compliance Indicators

- [ ] All data processing has documented legal basis
- [ ] Patients can request data access/correction
- [ ] Privacy policy published and accessible
- [ ] Retention periods defined and enforced
- [ ] Breach response procedures documented and tested

### Operational Metrics

- Patient request response time < 15 days (LGPD requirement)
- Staff training completion rate > 90%
- Breach detection time < 24 hours
- Data retention automation > 95% accuracy

## Notes for Implementation

- Each phase includes **detailed technical specifications**
- **Database migrations** are designed to be reversible
- **Staff training materials** included in each phase
- **Testing procedures** specified for each component
- **Documentation templates** provided for legal compliance

## Legal Disclaimer

This implementation plan is based on current understanding of LGPD requirements as of 2025. It provides **technical guidance only** and does not constitute legal advice. Organizations should consult with qualified legal counsel familiar with LGPD medical data requirements before implementation.

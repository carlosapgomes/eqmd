# User Lifecycle Management Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan implements comprehensive user lifecycle management for EquipeMed, addressing the critical need for automated account expiration, activity tracking, and access control for medical professionals with varying tenure (residents, students, temporary staff).

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues:**
- No automated account expiration for residents/students
- Manual deactivation is error-prone and often delayed
- LGPD compliance risk from departed users retaining access
- No systematic tracking of user activity or access reviews

**Security Risks:**
- Departed staff maintaining access to patient data
- Inactive accounts vulnerable to compromise
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Difficulty tracking who has current valid access

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Database Schema Extensions**: New fields for expiration, activity tracking, and status management
2. **Middleware Enhancement**: Integration with existing authentication and terms acceptance flow  
3. **Management Commands**: Automated daily/weekly maintenance tasks
4. **Admin Interface**: User lifecycle dashboard and bulk management tools
5. **Notification System**: Automated warnings and renewal reminders

### Integration Points

- **Existing Security Systems**: Works with password change requirements and terms acceptance
- **Audit History**: Leverages `simple-history` for complete lifecycle tracking
- **Permission System**: Integrates with role-based access control
- **Middleware Stack**: Extends current authentication and security middleware

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Schema Foundation
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**
**Priority: High**

Core database structure to support all lifecycle management features.

### Phase 2: Middleware and Core Logic
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks** 
**Priority: High**

Authentication flow integration and automated expiration checking.

### Phase 3: Management Commands and Automation
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**
**Priority: Medium**

Daily maintenance tasks and administrative tools.

### Phase 4: Admin Interface and Dashboards
**Timeline: 2-3 weeks**
**Priority: Medium**

User-friendly management interface for administrators.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features and Monitoring
**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**
**Priority: Low**

Enhanced reporting, bulk operations, and integration capabilities.

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

Each phase includes:
- **Technical specifications**
- **Database migrations**
- **Code implementation details**
- **Testing requirements**
- **Security considerations**
- **Documentation needs**

## Success Criteria

- ✅ **Automated Expiration**: Users automatically disabled based on role-specific rules
- ✅ **Activity Tracking**: Meaningful user activity monitored and recorded
- ✅ **Compliance Ready**: Complete audit trail for regulatory requirements
- ✅ **Admin Efficiency**: Easy bulk management and renewal workflows
- ✅ **Security Integration**: Seamless integration with existing security systems
- ✅ **Zero Disruption**: No impact on current user workflows during implementation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration**: Careful schema changes with rollback procedures
- **Authentication Flow**: Thorough testing to avoid login disruptions
- **Performance Impact**: Efficient queries and caching strategies

### Operational Risks  
- **User Communication**: Clear notifications about expiration policies
- **Admin Training**: Documentation and training for new management features
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased activation with monitoring and feedback

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve Plan**: Stakeholder review of complete implementation strategy
2. **Begin Phase 1**: Start with database schema implementation
3. **Testing Strategy**: Develop comprehensive test suite for each phase
4. **Documentation**: Create admin guides and user communication materials

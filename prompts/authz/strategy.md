# Recommended Implementation Strategy

Based on the requirements, I recommend a hybrid approach:

1. **Use Django's built-in permission system** for basic model-level permissions
2. **Implement utility functions** for complex permission checks
3. **Add middleware** for hospital context management
4. **Create decorators** for common view-level permission checks
5. **Use template tags** for permission checks in templates

## Key Implementation Considerations:

1. **Hospital Context Management**:

   - Store current hospital in session
   - Create middleware to make it available to views
   - Add methods to switch between hospitals

2. **Role-Based Permissions**:

   - Map profession types to Django groups
   - Assign appropriate permissions to each group
   - Create management command to set up permissions

3. **Object-Level Permissions**:

   - Implement utility functions for complex checks
   - Use decorators to apply checks in views
   - Create template tags for UI permissions

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Cache permission results where appropriate
   - Use select_related/prefetch_related to minimize queries
   - Consider using a third-party package like django-guardian for complex scenarios

This approach balances Django's built-in permission system with custom logic for the specific requirements of EquipeMed, while maintaining good separation of concerns and keeping the code maintainable.

# Media Feature Plan Request

## Your Mission

Based on our conversation in the current session, create a detailed step-by-step plan to implement the media feature.

Divide it in two main phases:
1. Media app initial implementation (app folders, main files, settings.py)
2. Three Vertical Sliced plans for each medial model (single image, image series, and short video clips)
Each vertical sliced plan should be divided in 3 vertical slices:
  1. Model and admin
  2. Forms and views
  3. Templates and testing

Save phase 1 in the file @prompts/media/media_initial_implementation_plan.md
Save phase 2 in the files
 @prompts/media/media_implementation_plan_single_image.md, 
 @prompts/media/media_implementation_plan_image_series.md, and 
 @prompts/media/media_implementation_plan_short_video_clips.md

 Follow the testing, styling, and all the additional recommendations at CLAUDE.md and, files in the @docs/ folder, and the conversation we had in the current session.

 Do not write any code, just create the files with detailed step-by-step plans.

# Client-Side Video Compression Implementation Plan

## ffmpeg.wasm Integration for Medical Mobile Video Uploads

### Executive Summary

This plan outlines implementing client-side video compression using ffmpeg.wasm as a progressive enhancement to the existing EquipeMed video upload system. The implementation prioritizes medical workflow reliability, mobile device compatibility, and maintains all existing server-side security validations.

**Key Principle**: Compression as enhancement, not replacement - always maintain fallback to current direct upload system.
